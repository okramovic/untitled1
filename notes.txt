clone() - As the method implies this method creates a clone of the response.
redirect() - This method creates a new response but with a different URL.
arrayBuffer() - In here we return a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer.
formData() - Also returns a promise but one that resolves with FormData object.
blob() - This is one resolves with a Blob.
text() - In this case it resolves with a string.
json() - Lastly we have the method to that resolves the promise with JSON.
